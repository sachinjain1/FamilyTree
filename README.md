# FamilyTree

Our story is set in the planet of Lengaburu......in the distant, distant galaxy of Tara B. And our protagonists are King Shan, Queen Anga & their family.  
King Shan is the emperor of Lengaburu and has been ruling the planet for the last 350 years (they have long lives in Lengaburu, you see!). Let’s write some code to get to know the family.  
This coding problem is for backend and fullstack developers and tests object oriented fundamentals.

Write code to model out the King Shan family tree so that: • Given a ‘name’ and a ‘relationship’, you should output the people corresponding to the relationship in the order in which they were added to the family tree. • You should be able to add a child to any family in the tree through the mother. 

relationships -> Paternal-Uncle Maternal-Uncle Paternal-Aunt Maternal-Aunt Sister-In-Law Brother-In-Law Son Daughter Siblings
